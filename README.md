# cms0057-sample-deploy

This repository contains sample deployment files to deploy InterSystems Payer Services solutions. Note that these are sample files intended to be used along with the [InterSystems Payer Service user documentation](https://docs.intersystems.com/hslatest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=HSPSDeploy_intro).

**These sample files ARE NOT intended for direct usage in production environments.**

A single Payer Services (HP) component application consists of a stack with two containers:

- a Web Gateway container
- an InterSystems IRIS&reg; For Health instance container
  
To manage the APIs for all of the Payer Services components that you deploy, you may also deploy a _separate_ InterSystems API Manager (IAM) container stack. For licensing purposes, IAM requires a container to host a separate IRIS instance with your IAM-enabled license key and a Web Gateway container.

The sections below describe the sample files provided in this repository to deploy Payer Services solution applications:
- [Repository Structure](#repository-structure)
- [sample\_deploy](#sample_deploy)
  - [config/iris](#configiris)
  - [web-gateway](#web-gateway)
  - [docker-compose-hp and hp.container.env](#docker-compose-hp-and-hpcontainerenv)
  - [docker-compose-iam and iam.container.env](#docker-compose-iam-and-iamcontainerenv)
  - [iam-register-entrypoint.sh](#iam-register-entrypointsh)
  - [iam-services-config.JSON](#iam-services-configjson)
- [sample\_configs](#sample_configs)

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured into two top level directories: `sample_deploy/` and `sample_configs/`.
- `sample_deploy/` contains the directory structure recommended to deploy the component and IAM container stacks. 
While the directory structure can be altered, this requires that you override variables in the environment (.env) files.
- `sample_configs/` contains example files for configuring Payer Services components and a separate InterSystems API Manager component.

## sample_deploy

This directory contains sample files for container stack deployment. Note that it includes deployment files for both Payer Services (under `./HP/`) and InterSystems API Manager (IAM) containers (under `./IAM/`). Each product runs in its own independent container stack. You may add more sub-directories for additional HP components. You may deploy your component and IAM stacks on the same host or on different hosts.

The Payer Services (`./HP/`) container stack deployment files include:
  - IRIS configuration files under `./HP/config/`, including:
    - `iris.key`
    - `merge.cpf`
  - web-gateway deployment files under `./HP/web-gateway/`, including:
    - SSL certificates
    - web gateway configurations
  - `hp.container.env` â€” Environment file
  - `docker-compose-hp.yml` â€” Compose file

The IAM (`./IAM/`) container stack deployment files include:
  - IRIS configuration files under `./IAM/config/`, including:
    - `iris.key`
    - `merge.cpf`
  - web-gateway deployment files under `./IAM/web-gateway/`, including:
    - SSL certificates
    - web gateway configurations
  - `iam.container.env` â€” Environment file
  - `docker-compose-iam.yml` â€” Compose file
  - `iam-register-entrypoint.sh` â€” Config script
  - `iam-services-config.JSON` â€” Endpoint specs

The directory structure is as follows:

Below we break down the roles of the various directories and files. For directories and files whose locations can be changed, the corresponding environment variables that control the directory locations are also referenced. Note that the directory-related environment variables are optional. If you do not specify directory-related environment variable values, then you **must** use the default directory structure referenced in the above image and detailed below.

### config/iris

A ./config/iris/ directory is required for each Payer Services component stack and for the InterSystems IRIS instance required to license IAM. This directory contains all necessary configuration-related files used at container deployment time for InterSystems IRIS-specific configuration.  

**NOTE:** 
 - Any files under this directory are NOT used during the active
   lifetime of the container. Other storage locations are used for
   storing data needed during the lifetime of a running container.
  - No data ingestion directory is provided by default. You may pass data
   into a service using the REST APIs.

This directory MUST consist of, at a minimum, an `iris.key` file, either for the Payer Services solution license key that includes the component image that you are deploying, or for the IAM license key. If you wish to use InterSystems API Manager features for your component, then you must use an IAM-enabled license (if available).

If there are any startup-related configuration settings, you must also include a `merge.cpf` file. If your Payer Services component will use IAM, you must set the IAM _password_ in this file. Its value should match the IAM_USER_PWD environment variable in `iam.container.env`. The example file that is provided sets up the component to use IAM.

Environment variables related to this directory: 
- `EXTERNAL_IRIS_CONFIG_DIRECTORY`
- `ISC_CONFIG_DIRECTORY`
- `ISC_CPF_MERGE_FILE_NAME`

### web-gateway

This subdirectory contains the files necessary to deploy an InterSystems Web Gateway image, which is documented in the [InterSystems Web Gateway documentation](https://docs.intersystems.com/irislatest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=GCGI).

If you are already familiar with the InterSystems Web Gateway, a sample compose file for deploying an InterSystems Web Gateway is provided in the [InterSystems Community Github repo](https://github.com/intersystems-community/webgateway-examples/tree/master/demo-compose).

### docker-compose-hp and hp.container.env

To deploy the Payer Services component container stack, make sure that your environment file `hp.container.env` is configured, then run the following command from within `./sample-deploy/HP/`:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-hp.yml --env-file hp.container.env up
```
This command configures a single Payer Services application stack for a component consisting of two containers: an InterSystems IRIS for Health instance and a Web Gateway instance.

Before you run the command, you must populate the values in the environment file,  `hp.container.env`. The environment file describes what each variable does. This is further fleshed out in the [InterSystems Payer Services user documentation](https://docs.intersystems.com/hslatest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=HSPSDeploy_container#HSPSDeploy_container_env_file). You can see the usage in the  `docker-compose-hp.yml` file.  

The environment variables, and their corresponding defaults in the `docker-compose.yml` file, point to other relative directories or files.

### docker-compose-iam and iam.container.env
To deploy the Intersystems API Manager container stack, make sure that your environment file `iam.container.env` is configured, then run the following command from within `./sample-deploy/IAM/`:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-iam.yml --env-file iam.container.env up
```
This command configures a single IAM stack consisting of 6 containers: iam, iam-register, iam-migrations, db, web-gateway, and iris. Note that the `iam-migrations` container (and `iam-register` container, if endpoints are configured from JSON file) is expected to complete work and exit shortly after starting.

Before you run the command, you must populate the values in the environment file, `iam.container.env`. The environment file describes what each variable does. This is further fleshed out in the [InterSystems Payer Services user documentation](https://docs.intersystems.com/hslatest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=HSPSDeploy_apimgr). You can see the usage in the `docker-compose-iam.yml` file.  

The IAM stack is independent from for your Payer Services solution component stacks. It uses an http connection to communicate with Payer Services APIs. Make sure that your component container stacks and IAM stack are deployed within the same network.

In addition to the environment and compose file, you also need to configure an `iam-register-entrypoint.sh` and `iam-services-config.JSON`. These files register the Payer Service API endpoints on IAM during deployment:

#### iam-register-entrypoint.sh

Required for registering endpoints on IAM at deployment time. This file is an entrypoint script containing curl calls to register settings with the IAM container. You should not have to edit this file.

#### iam-services-config.JSON

Required for registering endpoints on IAM at deployment time. A JSON file that contains IAM settings information. Edit this file to identify each Payer Services component that you deploy as one of the "services".

 - The `url` of the service should be a FQDN pointing to a Payer Services component container.
 - Under each service, you may add one or more routes to match requests:
   - Each route should have its unique `name` and `paths`(as a prefix in IAM-redirected endpoint, e.g. unique instance name)                             
   - Use `https` for _protocol_, and set _strip path_ to `true`.

## sample_configs

This directory contains sample configuration files for your solution application. The configs are not for direct use and are subject to changes.
You may move sample config files to `/config` folder under your deploy directory, then reference the file path in you docker-compose and `.container.env` file.
